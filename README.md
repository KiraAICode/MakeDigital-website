### Hello everyone.
### We are MakeDigital.
### We are a startup in the virtual influencer industry.
You might have heard of such Instagram/Facebook influencer as Miquela, or lil Miquela.

She is a 19 year old influencer, singer and songwriter, but she's **NOT** a human being.

She's made by a company named Brud, which is also behind Bermuda (isbae) and Blawko(22).

Here at MakeDigital New York, we managed to create our own AI CGI influencer named Kira.

Kira is a CGI character, who lives her regular digital girl's life until she realises she's being stalked by an antivirus due to a bug in her system.

She managed to run away, but they found her partying at the club on Christmas night and chased her.

Kira decided to hide and change her appearance and name and became T-L, the girl from the future.

*That is only a part of her story.*

It's being written by a professional storywriter with the help of Kira's audience and artificial intelligence so that you never know what will happen next and the story is interesting to read and follow.

## Does Kira have any actual purpose?
No. She is just an experiment, but we hope that Kira's Vlog's influence will develop a big platform and change many people's lives for the good.

At MakeDigital, we hope that virtual beings will become a part of our lives and will be used in many industries. 

We are sure that this experimental way of expressing yourself is great and that soon there will be more virtual beings helping humans in their lives. Remember,

### ***THIS*** is the future. And there's ***NOTHING*** to be afraid of.
